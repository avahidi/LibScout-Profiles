# LibScout Library Profiles

This supplemental repository provides ready-to-use library profiles for the Android/Java third-party library detector [LibScout](https://github.com/reddr/LibScout).
We try to update this repo regularly. Contributions are welcome. If you wish to include new libraries let me know.<br>

Due to copyright reasons we cannot publicy provide the <i>original</i> library SDKs. If you are interested in this data, send me an email (Erik Derr  [lastname@cs.uni-saarland.de]).
For original libraries SDKs (including history data) hosted at maven repositories you may use our scraper script from the LibScout repo.

## Profiles (Last update: 03/20/2018)

**NOTE (01/14/2019):** The current profiles are **no** longer compatible to LibScout version 2.2.0 and higher.<br>

You can find all ready-to-use <b>library profiles</b> for lib detection in apps in the profiles directory. They are created with default settings (MD5 hash algorithm and normal verboseness) and grouped by category (e.g. Advertising, Cloud, ..).<br>
The repository currently includes <b>248</b> unique libraries and <b>4,965</b> library versions.<br> For convenience, library-data.csv contains a complete list of library/-versions including meta data such as release dates.
